# 1. kmodespp 
Step1: 
1.1 center = matrix()_{p*k}, where the last m (the number of known categories) lines       are the centers of initial categories

1.2 For ith observation, calculate the distance: Dis[i]=sum(dist(X[i, ], center[j, ]),  where dist is defined as: sum(abs(a-b)), a, b are two vectors
getIdx: idx = Rank(Dis)[ceiling(0.75*length(Dis)]
X[idx, ] = center[m-1,]
Repeat 1.2 for (k-m) times until the matrix if fulfilled

Step2:
For n observations, calculate the distance between points and different centers, then put the points to the nearest points

Step3: calculate the new center of each clustering

Step4: if center moves, repeat step 2-4 until center anchors

# 2.  For the variables selected, run kmodespp where k ranges from origin to origin + length(variable_sleected)
 Calculate
